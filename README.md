# **Features**


## **Elevations Calculations**

MSMC is using heightmaps from Squad SDK to calculate the height difference between mortars and targets and ajust automatically the elevation. If your target is up a hill, MSMC will make sure you don't waste 1000 ammo point 20m too close.

Heightmaps are hidden : simply pick your map from the list and shoot.

## **Other Stuff**
- Full keyboard usability: autofocus to mortar & tab to switch between mortar and target
- Keypad formating: aka only accepting letters if there isn't already one, numbers and refusing special chars


# Thanks

this project is **largely** inspired by the work of Endebert on squadmc (https://github.com/Endebert/squadmc).
I wanted a lighter alternative to this great tool, some could say this project is just a new interface to squadmc calculation code.
